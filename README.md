## üìä Carbon API Integration

GreenBasket integrates with real-time carbon data sources to provide accurate sustainability metrics:

1. **Product-specific Carbon Footprint** (`/api/carbon/[id]`)
   - Calculates the carbon footprint of specific products
   - Compares with conventional alternatives to show savings

2. **Live Carbon Intensity** (`/api/carbon/live`)
   - Provides real-time grid carbon intensity data
   - Shows renewable energy mix and regional variations
   - Updates carbon calculations based on real-time data

The API will work properly in hosted environments as it includes proper error handling and fallbacks to mock data when external APIs are unavailable.
